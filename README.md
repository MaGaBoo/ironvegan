# ironvegan

Ironvegan is a vegan restaurants finder made with JavaScript, Node.js and Handlebars.

It´s my second project as student in Ironhack and it´s related to backend module. I did it with my mates Robert Cabrera and Calvin Torra.

Would you like to have a look? 
You can see the project down here:
